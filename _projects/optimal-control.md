# Optimal Control
In this repository, MATLAB and Python functions are provided for solving a general nonlinear optimal control problem using the gradient descent approach.

You can define your optimal control problem symbolically using MATLAB symbolic or Python sympy and the functions will solve the problem. Several demos are provided alongside the main functions. 

## Theoretical Background

In optimal control theory a standard optimal control is defined as

$$
   \begin{align}
      \text{minimize} &\phi(x(t_f) + \int_0^{t_f} g(x,u) dt \\
      s.t. &\dot{x} = f(x,u)
   \end{align}
$$

The solution to the problem above comes from calculus of variations. A Hamiltonian function is defined as

$$
   \mathcal{H} = g(x,u) + p^T f(x,u)
$$

And the optimal control input, in absence of input limits, can be calculated using the relationships below:

$$
   \begin{align}
      \dot{x} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial p} = f(x,u) \\
      \dot{p} = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial x} \\
      \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial u} = 0 
   \end{align}
$$

Here `p` denotes the co-states. This set of equations is generally hard to solve, because they are two point boundary nonlinear equations. The initial values of `x` and the final values of `p` are known.
One way to solve this set of equations is using the gradient descent algorithm. An initial guess of the control input `u` is selected and the equations are solved for `x` and `p`, given the boundary values. Then `u` is corrected using the gradient of the Hamiltonian. 

### Free Final Time Problems

When the final time $t_f$ is not specified and can be freely chosen to minimize the cost, an additional optimality condition must be satisfied. This condition is known as the _transversality condition_ for free final time.

For a problem with free $t_f$, the total cost is:

$$
   J = \phi(x(t_f), t_f) + \int_0^{t_f} g(x,u) \, dt
$$

At the optimal solution, not only must the control satisfy $\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial u} = 0$ (in unconstrained input case), but the final time must also satisfy:

$$
   \frac{dJ}{dt_f} = \mathcal{H}(x(t_f), u(t_f), p(t_f)) + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\bigg|_{t_f} = 0
$$

This condition arises because when $t_f$ is perturbed by a small amount $\delta t_f$, the cost changes due to two effects:  
- the terminal cost changes as $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \delta t_f$
-  the integral cost changes by adding a time slice of width $\delta t_f$ with integrand $g + p^T f = \mathcal{H}$.

At optimality, these combined effects must sum to zero.

The solver implements this by performing alternating optimization: first updating the control `u` via gradient descent on $\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial u}$, then updating the final time $t_f$ via gradient descent on $\frac{dJ}{dt_f}$. Both steps use Armijo backtracking line search to ensure cost reduction. For more details on the transversality condition, see the [Wikipedia article on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin%27s_maximum_principle).


## Documentation

The exact logic explained in [the theoretical background](#theoretical-background) has been implemented in the function [optimalControlSolver](/matlab/optimalControlSolver.m) (and [the same function](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/python/optimalControlSolver.py) for Python). Here, we go over the variables, inputs and outputs of the function.

I've only explained the MATLAB script, but the Python function is similar as well. I've even tried to use the exact same names in both functions.

Problem:
   
   $$
      \begin{aligned}
         \text{minimize}& J = Phi(x(tf)) + ∫_0^{tf} g(x(t), u(t)) dt \\
         \text{subject to}& ẋ = f(x,u),\quad x(0) = x0
      \end{aligned}
   $$

## Notes

- Instead of a simple gradient descent with a constant step size, the Armijo condition is checked every time and backtracking is used to find an appropriate step size
- Three sample scripts have been provided:
   1. [demo.m](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/matlab/demo.m) ([demo.py](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/python/demo.py) for Python) contains a linear system with two states and two inputs.
   2. [CSTR.m](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/matlab/CSTR.m) ([CSTR.py](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/python/CSTR.py) for Python) solves the optimal control problem for a CSTR system (example 6.2-2 from [Kirk's book](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fCh2SAtWIdwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=optimal+control+Kirk&ots=xziIYkb-e4&sig=fJ9SZLSPHDYESgw6TMzxO8K2HBo)).
   3. [Free time CSTR](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/matlab/CSTR_freeTf.m) ([CSTR_freeTf.py](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/python/CSTR_freeTf.py) for Python) solves the same optimal control problem as [CSTR.m](https://github.com/MRGilak/Optimal-Control/blob/main/matlab/CSTR.m), but with free final time
