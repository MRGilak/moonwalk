>[!summary] Summary
>This paper introduces (and contributes to) [MFAC](mfac).
>A general SISO nonlinear system is considered as:
>$$
> y(k+1)=f(y(k),...,y(k-n_y),u(k),...,u(k-n_u))
>$$
>A constant $L$ under the name _control input length constant of linearization_ has been introduced. Under two very simple assumptions (one of them being that the system has to be Lipschitz), an equivalent PFDL description is introduced:
>$$
>\Delta y(k+1) = \Phi^T(k) \Delta U(k)
>$$
>Parameter $\Phi$ is then estimated online and used for calculating the control input that minimizes a one-step-ahead cost function.
 
This paper introduces and contributes to [MFAC](mfac), especially PFDL and CFDL.
