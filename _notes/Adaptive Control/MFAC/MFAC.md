MFAC refers to model free adaptive control, which is is a data-driven approach to [adaptive control](adaptive-control). The core idea stems from a concept called pseudo-partial derivative (PPD). Here is its introduction in [this paper](a-novel-data-driven-control-approach-for-a-class-of-discrete-time-nonlinear-systems):
>[!definition] Instead of identifying a more or less nonlinear model of a plant, an equivalent dynamical linearization model is built along the dynamic operation points of the closed-loop system using a new dynamic linearization technique with a novel concept called pseudo-partial derivative (PPD). The time-varying PPD could be estimated merely using the I/O measurement data of a controlled plant. The dynamic linearization techniques include the partial form dynamic linearization (PFDL), the compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL), and the full form dynamic linearization (FFDL).

>[!note] Note
>Model free adaptive control is closely related to [Data-driven Control](data-driven-control)
