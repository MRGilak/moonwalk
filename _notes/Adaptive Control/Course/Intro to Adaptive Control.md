excerpt: "Control is used for these purposes:"

Control is used for these purposes:
- Closed-loop Stability
- Closed-loop Robustness
- Tracking a Reference Signal
- Good Transient Behavior
- Rejecting or Mitigating Disturbance Effects
- Mitigating Noise Effects
The challenge is that the system model is often incomplete or unprecise. This could be because the actual model of the system is either unavailable or too complicated to be used. It could also be that the actual model is time-varying, has unmodeled dynamics or the disturbances aren't known.
