> - **Abstract:** This paper presents a practical veriﬁcation of an Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) method in governing a multidimensional system. The experiments were conducted on a two degrees of a freedom planar manipulator with only partial knowledge about the mathematical model of the plant. This multi input multi output system was controlled with a set of two, independent, single input single output ADRC controllers, each regulating one of the manipulator degree of freedom. Modeling uncertainty (nonlinearities, cross-coupling eﬀects, etc.) and external disturbances were assumed to be a part of the disturbance, to be estimated with an observer and cancelled on-line in the control loop. The ADRC robustness was experimentally compared with the results obtained from using two decentralized, classic PID controllers. Both control methods were tested under various conditions, e.g. changing the inertial parameters of the plant. Signiﬁcantly better results, in terms of parametric robustness, have been reported for the ADRC approach.

> To plan a trajectory in the Cartesian space, obtaining the desired state-space signals is necessary, hence the inverse kinematics needs to be implemented. In general, this task is not trivial because of ambiguous solutions obtained by calculations. That is, most of the end effector positions can be achieved with more than one state configuration.

> We choose the pole to be the central point, i.e. (Ox, Oy). The error is described with following equations:  eρ = ρd − ρ,  eφ = φd − φ, (28)  where ρd [m] and ρ [m] describe the desired and the actual trajectory modulus respectively, while φd [rad] and φ [rad] represent the desired and the actual trajectory phase, respectively. They are obtained with the equations seen below:  ρ = √(x − Ox)2 + (y − Oy)2,  φ = atan2c (y − Oy, x − Ox) , (29)  where atan2c(·) : R2 → R is a two argument, continuous version of arcus tangent function.

> To depict the quality of path following in means of shape projection, a Curvature Projection Error (CPE) is introduced. The CPE is calculated for each point of the end effector achieved path. All points of the path are subscribed to one of four groups of points, each representing one side of the designed path rectangle. The CPE denotes the distance between the point of the achieved path and the closest point in designed path, with an assumption that both points ought to be located in the same group.

> The whole idea of using a disturbance observer to perform our “feedback linearization” is to estimate the uncertainties in real time. In theory, the smallest possible sampling time is thus desirable. However, we noticed two drawbacks of decreasing that time in practice. First is the presence of peaking phenomenon in which the initial estimator error is unacceptably large. This effect was analyzed minutely in [22]. Second drawback is the computation power limitation we encountered while working on the DSP board.
