Here, we will focus on controlling a 2DoF robot single leg.

# overview of the entire project
The project can be separated into several parts:
1. Finding a mathematical model for the leg in [here](/notes/Robotics/Mathematical Modeling of a Single Leg Robot/)
2. Studying about different control methods used in literature in [here](/notes/Robotics/2DoF Robot Control Literature/)
3. Perform system identification to get a numerical model of the system in [here](/notes/Robotics/Single Leg Robot System Identification/)
4. Choose a controller and test it  on the mathematical model in Simulink in [here](/notes/Robotics/Single Leg Robot Numerical Model/)
5. Test the controller with the ADAMS model in [here](/notes/Robotics/Single Leg Robot Controller Implementation in ADAMS-Simulink/)
6. Test the controller on the leg in [here](/notes/Robotics/Single Leg Robot Controller Real-world Implementation/)
