excerpt: "Research on 2DoF robot control has explored various approaches, including the use of Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) to mitigate modeling uncertainty."
---

Several papers have been reviewed for controlling a 2DoF robotic manipulator or leg, including:
- [This paper](/notes/active-disturbance-rejection-control-of-a-2dof-manipulator-with-significant-modeling-uncertainty/) uses two separate ADRC controllers for the two 2DoF robot. The ADRC results are compared with a traditional PID controller.

That's it for now :)
