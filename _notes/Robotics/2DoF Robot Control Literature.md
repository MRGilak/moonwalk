excerpt: "2DoF robot control involves using various methods, including Active Disturbance Rejection Control. This approach has been compared to traditional PID control in existing literature."

Several papers have been reviewed for controlling a 2DoF robotic manipulator or leg, including:
- [This paper](/notes/active-disturbance-rejection-control-of-a-2dof-manipulator-with-significant-modeling-uncertainty/) uses two separate ADRC controllers for the two 2DoF robot. The ADRC results are compared with a traditional PID controller.

That's it for now :)
