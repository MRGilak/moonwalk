The motors used in this project are [Go-M8010-6 motors](https://www.unitree.com/go1/motor). You can read more about them [here](/notes/Robotics/Single Leg Project/Single Leg Motors/). 

We are currently running basic tests on the motor. Full SLIP tests will be conducted later. Below are the videos of testing the hip and the knee joints of the leg.
