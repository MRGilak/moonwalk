excerpt: "In a world where secrets are just a hack away, cryptography is the guardian of confidentiality, using mysterious codes to protect messages from prying eyes like Eves. But how do Alice and Bob keep their secrets safe in the digital age?"

Imagine Alice and Bob have a very important secret. They want to communicate the message securely, but Eve is eavesdropping. This is where cryptography comes into play. Alice can lock the message in a box that only her and Bob know the combination to (__encryption__) and then Bob will open the box when he gets it (__decryption__). This way Eve cannot understand the message. Cryptography is the same thing, but instead of using physical locks, __ciphers__ are used. Cryptography is a very important field used at the heart of the modern world communication. Start leaning more about cryptography [here](/notes/Cryptography/Introduction to Cryptography/).
