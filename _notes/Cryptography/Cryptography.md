excerpt: "Imagine Alice and Bob have a very important secret. They want to communicate the message securely, but Eve is eavesdropping. This is where cryptography comes into play. Alice can lock the message in a box that only her and Bob know the combination to (__encryption__) and then Bob will open the box when he gets it (__decryption__). This way Eve cannot understand the message. Cryptography is the same thing, but instead of using physical locks, __ciphers__ are used. Cryptography is a very important field used at the heart of the modern world communication. Learn more about cryptography [[Introduction to Cryptography|here]]."
