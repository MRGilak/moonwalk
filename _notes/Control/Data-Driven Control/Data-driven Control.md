excerpt: "Data-driven control designs controllers using only input/output data from the controlled system, eliminating the need for a mathematical plant model."
---

Data-driven control is the branch of control that tries to eliminate the need for a proper plant model by using only the input/output data of plant to tune the controller parameters. A definition is presented in [this paper](/notes/Control/Adaptive Control/MFAC/From model-based control to data-driven control, Survey, classification and perspective/):
>[!definition] Data-driven Control
>Data-driven control includes all control theories and methods in which the controller is designed by directly using on-line or off-line I/O data of the controlled system or knowledge from the data processing but not any explicit information from mathematical model of the controlled process, and whose stability, convergence, and robustness can be guaranteed by rigorous mathematical analysis under certain reasonable assumptions.
