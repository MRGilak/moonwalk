Imagine Alice and Bob have a very important secret. They want to communicate the message securely, but Eve is eavesdropping. This is where cryptography comes into play. Alice can lock the message in a box that only her and Bob know the combination to (__encryption__) and then Bob will open the box when he gets it (__decryption__). This way Eve cannot understand the message. Cryptography is the same thing, but instead of using physical locks, __ciphers__ are used. Cryptography is a very important field used at the heart of the modern world communication. Start leaning more about cryptography [here](/notes/Computer Science/Cryptography/Introduction to Cryptography/), or take a look at [modular arithmetic](/notes/Computer Science/Cryptography/Modular arithmetic/) and [primality test](/notes/Computer Science/Cryptography/Primality Test/), which are usually used in cryptography.

[Crypto Hack](https://cryptohack.org/courses/intro/course_details/) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography) also have great resources for learning about cryptography.
