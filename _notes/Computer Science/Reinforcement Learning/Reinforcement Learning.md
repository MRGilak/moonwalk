#RL #Learning #computer-science 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is simultaneously a problem, a class of solution methods that work well on the class of problems, and the field that studies these problems and their solution methods. Reinforcement learning problems involve learning what to do so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.
You can read about RL in the following notes:
