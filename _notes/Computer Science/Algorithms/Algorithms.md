In computer science, an algorithm is a set of steps for a computer program to accomplish a task.
I am gathering a list of notes that explore the world of algorithms. As of now, these are the notes:
- [Binary Search](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Binary Search/): I suggest you start here if you're new to algorithms
- [Selection Sort](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Selection Sort/): the most basic search algorithm
- [Insertion Sort](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Insertion Sort/): another search algorithm, slightly better than [selection sort](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Selection Sort/)
- [Asymptotic Notation](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Asymptotic Notation/): Read this to get to know about the running time of algorithms
- [Recursive Algorithms](/notes/Computer Science/Algorithms/Recursive Algorithms/): a fundamental technique used in dynamic programming
