excerpt: "Overview of all the notes and projects"

This is the _home_ note. Here I've categorized my notes and projects.

As of now, there are three main categories in my notes:
- [Robotics](../Robotics/Robotics): This category contains my notes on my robotics-related projects, including [Single Leg Control](../Robotics/Single%20Leg%20Project/single-leg-control) and hopefully my other robotics-related works in the future.
- Computer Science: This category is home to my notes on algorithms, cryptography and reinforcement learning.
- Control: Here is where I keep my control-related notes.
- 
For now, I am focusing on [Robotics](../Robotics/Robotics). General areas of research interest include:
- [Robotics](../Robotics/Robotics)
- Nonlinear Control
- [Adaptive Control](../Control/Adaptive%20Control/adaptive-control)
- Optimal Control
- Active Disturbance Rejection Control
