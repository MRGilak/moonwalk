Welcome to the _home_ note. Here I've categorized my notes.
There are three main categories in my notes now:
- [Robotics](robotics): This category contains my notes on my robotics-related projects, including [Single Leg Control](single-leg-control) and hopefully later a manipulator control project and an autonomous vehicle project.
- Computer Science: This category is home to my notes on algorithms, cryptography and reinforcement learning.
- Control: Here is where I keep my control-related notes.
- 
For now, I am focusing on [Robotics](robotics). General areas of research interest include:
- [Robotics](robotics)
- Nonlinear Control
- [Adaptive Control](adaptive-control)
- Optimal Control
- Active Disturbance Rejection Control
